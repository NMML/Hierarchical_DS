Title: Functions for performing hierarchical analysis of distance
    sampling data
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: P.B. Conn
Description: Functions for performing hierarchical analysis of distance
    sampling data, with ability to use an areal spatial ICAR model on
    top of user supplied covariates to get at variation in abundance
    intensity.  The detection model can be specified as a function of
    observer and individual covariates, where a parameteric model is
    supposed for the population level distribution of covariate values.
    The model uses data augmentation and a reversible jump MCMC
    algorithm to sample animals that were never observed.  Also
    included is the ability to include point independence (increasing
    correlation multiple observer's observations as a function of
    distance, with independence assumed for distance=0 (or first
    distance bin).
